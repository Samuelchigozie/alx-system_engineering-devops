![Shell Loops and Conditions](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/individual.sh-for-loop-script.png)

This guide will cover various shell loops, conditions, and commands in Bash scripting. You will learn how to generate RSA keys, understand the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash`, and explore the usage of `while`, `until`, and `for` loops. Additionally, we will delve into `if`, `else`, `elif`, and case condition statements, as well as the `cut` command. Furthermore, we will discuss file and other comparison operators and how to use them effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will have gained knowledge in the following areas:

- Creating SSH keys
- Understanding the advantages of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- Utilizing `while`, `until`, and `for` loops
- Implementing `if`, `else`, `elif`, and case condition statements
- Working with the `cut` command
- Exploring file and other comparison operators and their usage

## Requirements

To follow along with the examples and exercises, please ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- All your Bash script files must be executable
- You are not allowed to use `awk`
- Your Bash scripts must pass `Shellcheck` (version 0.7.0) without any errors
- The first line of all your Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what the script is doing

## Concepts

Throughout this guide, we will cover the following concepts:

- `env`: Using `env` command to locate the Bash interpreter
- `cut`: Extracting sections from lines of files or strings
- `for`: Iterating over a list of values or elements
- `while`: Executing a block of code repeatedly while a condition is true
- `until`: Executing a block of code repeatedly until a condition is true
- `if`: Conditionally executing code based on a specific condition
