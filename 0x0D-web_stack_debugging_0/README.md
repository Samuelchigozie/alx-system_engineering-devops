# Unveiling the Mysteries of Web Stack Debugging

Welcome to the intriguing realm of web stack debugging! This series of projects revolves around the art of resurrecting malfunctioning web stacks within isolated containers. With each project, I was presented with a broken webstack and the challenge to restore it to a functional state. Armed with my skills and determination, I crafted scripts that performed the necessary commands to bring the web stack back to life.

## Delving into the Tasks at Hand :wrench:

Here's a glimpse into the initial task of this captivating journey:

### 0. The Quest for a Page
The opening task, symbolically represented by the script `0-give_me_a_page`, marks the inception of my web stack debugging adventure. This Bash script masterfully commands Apache to awaken on a web server. The culmination of my efforts results in a triumphant victory: the web server is rekindled, now responding to queries targeting its root.

This was just the beginning of my odyssey through web stack debugging, a journey that tested my troubleshooting prowess and scripting skills, while ultimately illuminating the path to resolving intricate web stack issues.
