In this project, you will find the following tasks and their respective descriptions:

### 0. OSI model
- [0-OSI_model](./0-OSI_model): This text file answers questions related to the OSI model, such as its definition and organization.

### 1. Types of network
- [1-types_of_network](./1-types_of_network): This text file provides answers to questions regarding different types of networks and their applications.

### 2. MAC and IP address
- [2-MAC_and_IP_address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address): This text file explains the concepts of MAC address and IP address, along with their respective roles in networking.

### 3. UDP and TCP
- [3-UDP_and_TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP): This text file discusses the characteristics and differences between UDP and TCP protocols.

### 4. TCP and UDP ports
- [4-TCP_and_UDP_ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports): This Bash script displays listening ports, including the PID and program name associated with each socket.

### 5. Is the host on the network
- [5-is_the_host_on_the_network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network): This Bash script pings an IP address provided as an argument to check if the host is on the network.

Feel free to explore and complete these tasks to enhance your understanding of networking basics!
